# UberEats Data Warehouse and Dashboard Creation

Our collaborative project focused on building a relational logical data model for the Ubereats POS system and a Star Schema logical model using MySQL. Using Tableau Prep, we meticulously manipulated, transformed, and validated data before loading it into our relational database and then into our data warehouse. We curated descriptive dashboards and conducted what-if analyses alongside predictive modeling using Tableau's Forecasting tool.
